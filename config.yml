# Configuration notes:
# - Each location can have multiple ISPs under the 'isps' section
# - ISP identifiers (primary, backup, cellular, etc.) are flexible - use descriptive names
# - gateway_ip: The IP address of the ISP's gateway/router
# - zabbix_hostname: Must match the hostname configured in Zabbix server (unique per ISP)
# - isp_name: Human readable ISP provider name
# - connection_type: Description of the connection role (Primary, Backup, etc.)

# To find gateway IPs:
# - Windows: ipconfig /all (look for Default Gateway)
# - Linux/Mac: ip route show | grep default
# - Router admin: usually shows WAN gateway for each connection
